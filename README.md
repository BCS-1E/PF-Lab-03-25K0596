# My Introduction
My name is Soha Khan, and **_I am currently a freshman at FAST-NUCES Karachi, enrolled in the BS Computer Science program_**. I have a growing interest in programming and problem-solving, and I enjoy exploring how code can be used to create efficient solutions.
## Skills Learned (ordered list)
1. So far, I have learned C++, which has helped me build a strong foundation in programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms.
2. At present, I am learning C, which is giving me a deeper understanding of low-level programming, memory management, and the fundamentals that form the backbone of many modern languages.
**_I am excited to continue expanding my skills, experimenting with different programming paradigms, and applying my knowledge in both academic and practical projects_**.
 ## Intrests (Unordered list)
