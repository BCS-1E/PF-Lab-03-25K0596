My name is Soha Khan, and I am currently a freshman at FAST-NUCES Karachi, enrolled in the BS Computer Science program. I have a growing interest in programming and problem-solving, and I enjoy exploring how code can be used to create efficient solutions.So far, I have learned C++, which has helped me build a strong foundation in programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. At present, I am learning C, which is giving me a deeper understanding of low-level programming, memory management, and the fundamentals that form the backbone of many modern languages.I am excited to continue expanding my skills, experimenting with different programming paradigms, and applying my knowledge in both academic and practical projects. Over time, I aim to explore more advanced areas such as software development, artificial intelligence, and web technologies.
